The task of the 21st century is to find solutions to the various problems -; 
biological, global environmental, informational, social systematic, and 
anthropological -; that for 20th century science technology were so 
perplexing. We believe that the key to success lies in grasping the concept 
of emergence.

It is this that has the potential to bring to flower a new science technology, 
opening the way for as yet undeveloped and unchallenged territory and 
thereby achieving that which pursuits within subdivided specialties have 
been unable to accomplish.
